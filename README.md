API Docs [Click Here](https://beta.pickaxeproject.com/apidocs/#/)

Some functionalities of the API are implemented without testing. Those are not guaranteed to work.

##todo:
On `app.js: line 44` remove the `!` from the confition to get the login flow to work. 

It is currently not working because of the API errors we are getting.
